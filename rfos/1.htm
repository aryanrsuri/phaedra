1. Work is the ultimate form of playâ€”or more practically, find something to do that gives you an ultimate form of joy, and make that your life's work. You weren't born with a north star, you can decide it.
2. Do not believe that you do not worship. If you do not worship a God, you worship something else: most often yourself in a hedonistic haze. Avoid this at all costs, that is an awesome responsibility most often left to God.
3. Seek a master, and soak up all that you can. They should be your well, and competitive drive (meaning that usurption is the ideal path). Never make the crucial mistake of believing you have no master, or that two is better than one.
4. There is an intrinsic will that is in you, a core lack, as Lacan would put it. What you truly desire, and what you think you seek will always operate at some distance from eachother. You will be Great, only when you admire the gap.

Heed this well, develop integrity, and always think: does this serve <i>my</i> purpose?
