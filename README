Phaedra is my1 body of essays on anything; ranging from materials engineering, political though, book reviews, philosophy or poetry. All of these memos (or documents) will share the same format in a RFO (Request-For-Opinion) as a rip off of IETF RFC2. I am doing this to challenge myself to think deeper, write coherently, about on concept, and challenge the reader to save themselves from the attention collapse. This is Phaedra.
