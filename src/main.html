        Is my<sup><a href="https://aryansuri.deno.dev/">1</a></sup> body of thought:
        ranging from materials engineering, political thought, book reviews, philosophy or poetry. All of these memos
        (or documents) will share the same format in a
        RFO (Request-For-Opinion) as a rip off of IETF RFC<sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>.
        I am doing this to challenge myself to think deeper, write coherently, about on concept, and challenge the
        reader to save themselves from the attention collapse. This is Phaedra.
      </p>
      <p>
        As is implied in the O in RFO, I request for any opinions you may have on my work. I do not believe in comments,
        but in thorough critique, which you can reach to me by e-mail<sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>.
