I Upon the precipice of death the genuineness of Ātman is revealed, suddenly the breath slows, your preordained purpose
is remembered, and the beauty of courage emerges. Thus, you must embrace inevitable death, and see it before you
everywhere. You shall live as a descendent of Arjuna.

II Men carry a modicum of God’s power: the ability to seed life. From seed, Men. This mighty burden, a transmutable life
force, is now perverted beyond measure. No wonder this earth has fallen to Kali. Men with no temperance. Men with no
integrity. Men with no faith. And a man with no faith is a kingdom with no king, succumbing to even the weakest bows and
slings.

III Shani offers two paths to Man in life: Ego desires pleasure above all while Ātman desires greatness above all. This
conflict is revealed in the ceaseless depression of a failed state or misdeed, the Ego’s descent into neurosis. So, heed
me and beware the Epicureans offering Greatness through Ego, as not equal are good and evil. Greatness, then, is
achieved in victory and the struggle of Ātman against Kali. Will you have courage? Will you have faith? Or will you walk
the path of jackals and the honourless?

IV Absolute Greatness requires Absolute Will.
